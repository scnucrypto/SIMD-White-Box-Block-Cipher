# white-box-SM4

White-box - SM4 Project Overview


This document outlines the contents of each of the files that make up the white-box-SM4 application.


SM4_equivalent.cpp:
    This is the document which implements the first round of the SM4 algorithm using the equivalent structure.

SM4.h:
    This is the declaration of the function used in the implementation of the SM4 algorithm.

SM4.c:
    This is the main application source file and the function file for the SM4 implementation. The SM4 algorithm is implemented in the main file as well as our white-box SM4 algorithm.

generateTable.h:
    This is the function declaration used in the white-box SM4 implementation.

generateTable.c:
    This is the function file for the SM4 white-box implementation, including the function to build the lookup tables.


***Note:
    Before run "SM4.c", please generate the file of "p" and "p8" with Matlab software and save them in E disk.
